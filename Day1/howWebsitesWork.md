# What is the internet?
The internet is the interconnection of two or more computers to share resources
These computers are identified by their IP addresses that are given to each device by their ISP

## How do websites works?
- websites use the client-server architecture  to send and receive data
- the client is a device that ask for a resource found on a server
- the server is a device that responses to request made my clients
- for this to work the client and server must have a way to identify each other
- this is done using IP addresses that assigned to each device by their ISP
- this address is sometimes tried to a domain name to make it easy to reference
- the client just enter the domain of the server that will be resolved into an IP address and the request is sent to the server then, the server also responds to the client
- the server also has come files running on it that is rendered to the client when he request for these files
- some of these files include html, css, js
